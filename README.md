# Discuss Feature – Interview Task

This repository contains the Discuss feature from our platform. 

### Visit: https://aptidude.in/discuss to see the implementation


### Your task is simple:

Go through the repository to understand the structure of how this feature is implemented.

You don’t need to go into details or read every line — just skim to get a sense of the flow.


### What We may Ask After this in the Interview

Be prepared to answer simple questions like:

How many different pages/components are there for this feature, and where are they located?

Which files are responsible for creating new posts or reading comments?

If you can identify the state management used.

which file you’d start reading first if I told you to debug an issue with like/view count incrementing?


#### The goal is to see how quickly you can skim through unfamiliar code and get a working understanding of its structure.
